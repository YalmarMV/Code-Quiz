# Code-Quiz

In these small project, I created a game call Code Quiz, where the user is able to test their knowledge on Coding. The app is simple and interactive with the user.

If the user gets a wrong answer, the app will show a red color on the answer. If ther user gets a correct answer, than it will become green. The quiz contains 7 questions and the user will be able to track the results. 

A timer will be set when u start the quiz, so the user will have an specific time to finish the game.
