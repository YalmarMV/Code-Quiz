# Code-Quiz

In these small project, I created a game call Code Quiz, where the user is able to test their knowledge on Coding. The app is simple and interactive with the user.

If the user gets a wrong answer, the app will show a red circule on the bottom of the app. If the user gets a correct answer, than it will become green. The quiz contains 6 questions and the user will be able to track the results. 

A timer will be set when the user start the quiz, and the user will have 15 seconds to answer every question. Every time the user start a different question, the timer will reset to 15 seconds. If the user does not answer in the corresponding time, than the app will move to the next question.
